## Technologies Used

* [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
* [PostgreSQL] (https://www.postgresql.org/) PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
* [TypeORM] (https://typeorm.io/) TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large-scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.
* [bcrypt] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) A library to help you hash passwords.
* [JWT] (https://jwt.io/)  JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources.
* [class-validator] (https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) Allows use of decorator and non-decorator based validation. Internally uses validator.js to perform validation. Class-validator works on both browser and node.js platforms.
* [class-transformer] (https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer) Its ES6 and Typescript era. Nowadays you are working with classes and constructor objects more than ever. Class-transformer allows you to transform plain object to some instance of class and versa. Also it allows to serialize / deserialize object based on criteria. This tool is super useful on both frontend and backend.
* [dotenv] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
* [swagger] (https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) The OpenAPI specification is a language-agnostic definition format used to describe RESTful APIs. Nest provides a dedicated module which allows generating such a specification by leveraging decorators.
